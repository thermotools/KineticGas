This release is automatically updated whenever a pull request is merged to `main`, and is built from the branch that was merged to `main` (not `main` itself).

For stable releases of `KineticGas`, see releases named `vX.Y.Z`.

To install this release, download the appropriate `.whl` file, and `pip install <name-of-file>.whl`.

Documentation and user guides for the latest version are found at [thermotools.github.io/KineticGas](thermotools.github.io/KineticGas), but are likely not as well maintained as the documentation and guides for stable releases.
