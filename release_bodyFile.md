This release is automatically updated whenever a pull request is merged to `main`, and is built from the branch that was merged to `main` (not `main` itself).

For stable releases of `KineticGas`, see releases named `vX.Y.Z`.

To install this release, download and unzip the appropriate zip file, then install with `pip install pykingas -f wheels-<system>-latest/`, where `wheels-<system>-latest` is the directory created by unzipping the file.

Documentation and user guides for the latest version are found at [thermotools.github.io/KineticGas](thermotools.github.io/KineticGas), but are likely not as well maintained as the documentation and guides for stable releases.
