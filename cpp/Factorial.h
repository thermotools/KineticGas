Contains: Classes to facilitate analytic simplification of fractions containing factorials to prevent overflow.
            The Fac, Product and Frac classes represent analytic factorials, products and fractions. They overload
            the relevant arithmetic operators (* and /), and are simplified analytically before numerical evaluation when
            evaluated with <expression.eval()>

          Frac can be initialized from both Fac and Product, as a fraction with denominator = 1. Thus, all arithmetic
          is only defined for the Frac class, and when eg. computing Fac * Product, the result is implicitly converted
          to a fraction.

          The function 'ipow(int, int) is also defined. This function is an exponential that returns a Product (not
          evaluated to an int), to ensure that Fractions containing powers can be simplified before evaluation.

Working principle:
        A factorial is represented as a list of integers, up until the point of evaluation. Similarly, a Product is
        represented as a list of integers, and a single double, up until evaluation. A fraction is represented as
        a numerator and a denominator that are both Products.

        Upon evaluating a fraction (using Frac::eval()) common integers in the numerator and denominator are cancelled
        (in practice: set to 1), before both the numerator and denominator are evaluated (using Product::eval()) and the
        results are divided by each other, returning a double.

        This makes it possible to eg. evaluate Fac(100) / Fac(99) without any fear of overflow, and with minimal
        performance issues.

Note: The max number of integers in a Product or a factorial (Fac) is 1000. Exceeding this number leads to undefined
        behaviour (likely a segfault).
      The 'Frac' class cannot contain a sum of products in the numerator or the denominator. Both the numerator and the
      denominator must be pure products.
