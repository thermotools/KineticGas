## Getting started: In C++

For instructions on building the `KineticGas` C++ library, see the [installation guide](installation#c).

A basic example showing initialization of a model is found in [`cppExamples/basic.cpp`](), the `cppExamples` directory also contains a `CMakeLists.txt` showing how to obtain the required headers for the `KineticGas` library, as well as link the library to your program.
